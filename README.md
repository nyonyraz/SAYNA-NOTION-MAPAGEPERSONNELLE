# SAYNA-NOTION-MAPAGEPERSONNELLE
I sketched the design of my site by drawing inspiration from templates and conducting online research. I created a wireframe using Canva to get an overview.

I thought about the desired features for each section and how they would interact with each other, taking notes on wireframing tools.

I built the general structure of the site on Notion, creating key areas like the menu, shared resources, and the events calendar, while also starting to structure the page visually.

I created databases for each section (recipes, cocktails, sports & activities, music, etc.), with the necessary properties like dish types, preparation times, and difficulty.

I connected Tally and Google Sheets to my databases, creating forms for sports & activities and music. I ensured each field was linked to the correct data.

I added resources to the databases either directly or using the forms I had set up.

I fine-tuned the database settings by modifying views, hiding unnecessary fields, and displaying relevant properties. I also customized the icons and colors for a better visual appearance.

I linked the “resources” databases to the “events” database, allowing me to easily assign resources to each event. I created formulas to automatically calculate preparation times and music durations.

I added buttons to automate certain tasks, like creating events, to streamline the process.

I published my page on the web using Notion’s “Share to the web” feature, configuring the access so that visitors could only view the content.
